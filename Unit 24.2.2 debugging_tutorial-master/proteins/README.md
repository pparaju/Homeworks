# Analyzing Protein Data

## Question

Are monkeys genetically similar to bananas?

## Description

Compare monkey, banana and human proteins by counting how frequently their amino acids occur. This essentially means counting characters in strings, but some biological background is helpful to interpret the results (and bugs!).

The directories:

* `data/` - place to store donwloaded data.
* `output/` - place to store files generated by the program.

## Preparations

* Download *proteomes for **human, chimp and banana** as FASTA files* from the [UniProt database](http://www.uniprot.org/proteomes/). 
* Store them in the `data/` folder.

## Task

Debug `parse_uniprot.py`.
